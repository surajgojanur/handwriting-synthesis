DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HADOOP AND RDBMS
HADOOP RDBMS
In this both structured and unstructured data is processed
In this structured data is mostly processed
It is highly scalable It is less scalable than Hadoop
Ensures strong consistency through transactions
Ensures strong consistency through transactions
It stores huge volume of data It stores transformed and
aggregated data
It has some latency in response
It has no latency in response
Hadoop Ecosystem
Hadoop Ecosystem is a platform or a suite which provides
various services to solve the big data problems It includes
Apache projects and various commercial tools and solutions
There are four major elements of Hadoop ie HDFS MapReduce
YARN and Hadoop Common Utilities
Components of Hadoop Ecosystem
1 HDFS Hadoop Distributed File System
2 YARN Yet Another Resource Negotiator
3 MapReduce Programming based Data Processing
4 Spark InMemory data processing
5 PIG HIVE Query based processing of data services
6 HBase NoSQL Database
7 Mahout Spark MLLib machine learning algorithm
libraries
8 Solar Lucene Searching and Indexing
9 Zookeeper Managing cluster
10 Oozie Job Scheduling
HDFS is the primary or major component of Hadoop ecosystem
and is responsible for storing large data sets of structured
or unstructured data across various nodes and thereby
maintaining the metadata in the form of log files
YARN Yet Another Resource Negotiator as the name implies
YARN is the one who helps to manage the resources across
the clusters
MAPREDUCE By making the use of distributed and parallel
algorithms MapReduce makes it possible to carry over the
processing logic and helps to write applications which
transform big data sets into a manageable one
PIG It is a platform for structuring the data flow
processing and analyzing huge data setsPig does the work
of executing commands and in the background all the
activities of MapReduce are taken care of
HIVE It is highly scalable as it allows realtime processing
and batch processing both Also all the SQL datatypes are
supported by Hive thus making the query processing easier
MAHOUT allows Machine Learnability to a system or
application as the name suggests helps the system to develop
itself based on some patterns userenvironmental interaction
or on the basis of algorithms
NoSQL
NoSQL is a nonrelational database that is used to store the
data in the nontabular form NoSQL stands for Not only SQL
It also referred to as not only SQL or nonSQL is an
approach to database design that enables the storage and
querying of data outside the traditional structures found
in relational databases
Types of NoSQL Database
1 Keyvalue stores Ex Amazon DynamoDB
2 Columnoriented databases Cassandra
3 Documentbased databases MongoDB
4 Graphbased databasesNeo4j
Mongo DB
MongoDB is an opensource database compatible across
platforms and able to work with data using JSON and similar
formats It means that MongoDB isnt based on the tablelike
relational database structure but provides an altogether
different mechanism for storage and retrieval of data
It uses JSON format to insert the data
Importance of Mongo DB
1 It is a schemaless database that is simple to set up and
use
2 Because it is a schemaless database the code we write
specifies the schema
3 Data is saved in Binary JSON format a keyvalue pair no
joins are required
4 It stores data in RAM allowing quicker access to the data
5 It can be used to balance loads
6 It is inexpensive because it saves money on hardware and
storage
MongoDB Terminologies for RDBMS concepts
RDBMS MongoDB
Database Database
Table View Collection
Row Document JSON BSON
Column Field
Index Index
Join Embedded Document
Foreign Key Reference
Partition Shard
Basic Mongo DB Operations
Operation Decsription
use database name switched to database provided with
command
db To check currently selected database
show dbs Displays the list of databases
dbdropDatabase To Drop the database
dbcreateCollectioncollectionname To create collection
Object Id Format
An ObjectID is a 12byte Field Of BSON type
The first 4 bytes representing the Unix Timestamp of the
document
The next 3 bytes are the machine Id on which the MongoDB
server is running
The next 2 bytes are of process id
The last Field is 3 bytes used for increment the objectid
JSON Defination
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notationit is a
lightweight format for storing and transporting dataJSON
is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
and selfdescribing and easy to understand
JSON Syntax Rules
1 Data is in namevalue pairs
2 Data is separated by commas
3 Curly braces hold objects
4 Square brackets hold arrays
Example Of Json
_id 1
first_name Arun
last_name Rao
cell 8125552344
city hubli
email arungmail
hobbies scrapbooking eating waffles working
Difference Between JSON and BSON
JSON BSON
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation BSON stands for
Binary JavaScript Object Notation
JSON data contains its data basic in JSON format
BSON gives extra datatypes over the JSON data
Database like AnyDB redis etc stores information in JSON
format
MongoDB stores data in BSON format
JSON uses less space in comparison to BSON BSON uses more
space as compared to JSON
It is used for the transmission of data It is used for the
storage of the data
